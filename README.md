Machine Learning and Iris Prediction:

The goal is to build a model that can predict the species of a new iris flower based on its measurements.
This involves training a classification algorithm on the existing data (sepal and petal measurements with their corresponding species).
Popular algorithms for this task include k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees.
After training, the model can then be used to predict the species of a new iris flower by providing its measurements.
